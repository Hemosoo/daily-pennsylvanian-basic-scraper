```
User-agent: *
Crawl-delay: 10
Allow: /

User-agent: SemrushBot
Disallow: /
```

## Explanation

Here's what each line means:

User-agent: * → This applies to all web crawlers (since * is a wildcard representing any bot).
Crawl-delay: 10 → This tells all bots to wait 10 seconds between requests to avoid overloading the server.
Allow: / → This permits all bots to access the entire site.
Then, there’s a separate rule for a specific bot:

User-agent: SemrushBot → This specifically targets the SemrushBot, which is a well-known SEO and marketing analytics bot.
Disallow: / → SemrushBot is completely blocked from crawling the site
